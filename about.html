                <p class="para">  Our Mission is to provide you with exactly what  you need. Our services start from asking you what you want. We then ask you questions because for us the most important thing is to understand you. After that we make sure to explain you our vision as to what we think we can do. Then after multiple drafts we finally present you with something that we know you will love.</p>

                <h1 class="sidehead">Our History</h1>
                <p class="para"> I was always a  very passionate coder. It was one of my favourite things to do. Every time I sat down to code I felt like I was transported to this other world where I was the dragon slayer and the problems I had were dragons. It was my job to beat them and make my way to eternal glory. It was this idea that made me want to keep coding. I realised, that I could use this passion and help those around me. This is the idea I used and started building my career. My career revolved around understanding the needs of my clients and then making their vision come to reality. It started off from a small idea that eventually grew into what it is today</p>
